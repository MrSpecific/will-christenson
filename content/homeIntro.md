I'm a web developer living and working in Portland, Oregon. I focus on building durable, effective, and accessible projects using modern technologies.

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and you can check out the [source code](https://github.com/MrSpecific/will-christenson) to see it under the hood. There are also other examples of recent projects on my [**Work** page](/work).

If you're interested in working together, [get in touch](/contact).
